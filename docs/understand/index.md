One of the fundamental pillars of republican democracies is the idea that citizens from a certain local portions of the country elect local officials to represent their interests in government. On paper, this seems like a fair idea, but as the graphic above illustrates: it's only fair if "certain local portions of the country" is fairly defined. "Gerrymandering" is the act of manipulating district lines until your political party has a majority.

## Precincts

In the real world, each square in the graphic is called a precinct. They do not necessarily have similar populations, nor do they necessarily have similar geographic sizes, nor does every state have equal numbers of precincts. How precinct boundaries are decided [varies from state to state](http://redistricting.lls.edu/who.php).
